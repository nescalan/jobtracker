The create folder contains SQL snippets to create tables in the database. 
The delete folder contains SQL snippets to delete rows from tables in the database. 
The read folder contains SQL snippets to read rows from tables in the database. 
The update folder contains SQL snippets to update rows in tables in the database.

Each SQL snippet is named after the operation it performs. For example, the create_users.sql snippet creates the users table in the database. 
The delete_user.sql snippet deletes a row from the users table. The get_all_users.sql snippet retrieves all rows from the users table. 
The update_user.sql snippet updates a row in the users table.

The SQL snippets are grouped by operation to make it easier to find the snippet you need. 
For example, if you need to create a new user, you can look in the create folder for the create_users.sql snippet. 
If you need to delete a user, you can look in the delete folder for the delete_user.sql snippet.

The SQL snippets are stored in separate files so that they can be easily modified or updated. 
For example, if you need to change the way users are created, you can edit the create_users.sql snippet. 
If you need to add a new field to the users table, you can edit the create_users.sql snippet.
